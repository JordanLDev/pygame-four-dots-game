# pygame-four-dots-game

This is my first python game and is inspired by the classic connect four game. I first heard about pygame via social media and instead of following tutorials, I went straight to the pygame website and looked at the library. 

So far I've added a grid based sprite system that loops and draws the grid to a set frames per second (30).
This grid uses a transparent sprite .png file to create depth for when the counter is moving down through the columns.
I've implemented a bool for player one and two to change the counter colours and the player icon, feeding more visual information to clarify clearly who the current player is; Player one or Player two.

I plan to introduce many features to this game, further improving the experience for the players and potentially add it to a personal portfolio website.
